  Partie plagiée: Loeb's publishers have at their command all the advertising

Aldus had to organize his own selling system, his advertising had to be largely by private
correspondence with scholars and book-sellers throughout Europe laboriously composed with his
own hand; yet it was imperative that the business become as soon as possible self-supporting,
or at least that losses in one quarter should be recouped by profits in another.

It was in his edition of Virgil, 1501, that Aldus first employed the new cursive or sloping
letter which later came to be known in English printing as italic type

Brook Brownie, or How the Song Sparrow Got His Streaks

  His Mother was the Brook and his sisters were the Reeds,
  They, every one, applauded when he sang about his deeds.
  His vest was white, his mantle brown, as clear as they could be,
  And his songs were fairly bubbling o'er with melody and glee.
  But an envious Neighbour splashed with mud our Brownie's coat and vest,
  And then a final handful threw that stuck upon his breast.
  The Brook-bird's mother did her best to wash the stains away;
  But there they stuck, and, as it seems, are very like to stay.
  And so he wears the splashes and the mud blotch, as you see;
  But his songs are bubbling over still with melody and glee.

Diablo and the Dogwood

What a glorious thing is the Maytime Dogwood in our woods! How it does sing out its song! More
loudly and clearly it sings than any other spring flower! For it is not one, but a great chorus;
and I know it is singing that "The spring, the very spring is in the land!"

I suppose if one had King Solomon's fayland ears, one might hear the Dogwood music like a lot
of church bells pealing, like the chorus of the cathedral where Woodthrush is the preacher-priest
and the Veeries make responses.

It was Adam's favourite tree, they say, in the Garden of Eden

One of the common names of this splendid creature is "Milkweed Butterfly" because its grub
or caterpillar is fond of feeding on the leaves of the common milkweed.

The drawing shows the size and style of the grub; in colour it is yellow or yellowish green
with black bands.

As soon as it is grown big enough and fat enough, the grub hangs itself up as a "chrysalis"
which is a Greek word that may be freely rendered into "golden jewel." The middle drawing shows
its shape; in colour it is of a pale green with spots of gold, or as it has been described
"a green house with golden nails."

After about two weeks the great change takes place, and the bundle-baby or chrysalis opens

  Partie plagiée: This is the one that is often seen in flocks about mud puddles.

When I was a very small boy, I once caught a dozen of them, and made a little beehive to hold
them, thinking that they would settle down and make themselves at home, just like bees or pigeons.
But the grown-ups made me let them fly away, for the Sulphur is a kindly creature, and does
little or no harm.

One of the most beautiful things I ever came across, was, when about ten years old, I saw on
a fence stake ahead of me a big bird that was red, white and blue, with a flaming yellow fan-crest.
Then as I came closer, I knew that it was a red-headed woodpecker, with a Sulphur Butterfly
in his beak; this made the crest; what I thought was blue turned out to be his glossy black
back reflecting the blue sky.

  Partie plagiée: It was not that she was to meet Lord Mountclere, for he was only a name and a distant profile
to her: it was that her father would necessarily be present at the meeting, in the most anomalous
position that human nature could endure.

However, having often proved in her disjointed experience that the shortest way out of a difficulty
lies straight through it, Ethelberta decided to dine at the Doncastles',
and, as she murmured that she should have great pleasure in meeting
any friend of theirs, set about contriving how the encounter with
her dearest relative might be made safe and unsuspected.

She bade them adieu blithely; but the thoughts engendered by the invitation stood before her
as sorrowful and rayless ghosts which could not be laid.

Often at such conjunctures as these, when the futility of her great
undertaking was more than usually manifest, did Ethelberta long like
a tired child for the conclusion of the whole matter; when her work
should be over, and the evening come; when she might draw her boat
upon the shore, and in some thymy nook await eternal night with a
placid mind.

these are the two bright stars that make the outer side of the Dipper on the Big Bear's shoulder.

How the Pine Tree Tells Its Own Story

Suppose you are in the woods, and your woods in Canada, or the Northern States; you would see
at once two kinds of trees: Pines and Hardwoods.

Pines, or Evergreens, have leaves like needles, and are green all the year round; they bear
cones and have soft wood.

The Hardwoods, or Broadleaves, sometimes called Shedders, have broad leaves that are shed in
the fall; they bear nuts or berries and have hard wood.

Remember this, every tree that grows has flowers and seeds; and the tree can always be told
by its seeds, that is, its fruit

The Language of Hens

Yes; Hens talk somewhat as we do; only they haven't so many words, and don't depend on them

The chuck, chuck of invitation means, "Good food."

The tuk-ut-e-ah-tuk means, "Bless my soul, what is that?"

How shall we know the deadly Amanita among its kindly cousins, the good mushrooms? Wise men

white or yellow gills; and the white spores that fall from its gills if the cup, without the
stem, be laid gills down on a black paper for an hour.

By these things we may know the wan Demon of the woods, but the wisest Guides say to their

  Partie plagiée: The sting begins with an unpleasant itching which gets worse, especially if rubbed,
until it blisters and breaks open with sores which are very hard to heal.

The cause of the sting is a blistering oil, which is found in tiny drops on all parts of the
leaf and branches; it is a fixed oil; that is, it will not dry up, and as long as it is on
the skin, it keeps on burning and blistering, worse and worse.

THE CURE

And this is the cure for the sting of the Demon Vine:--

Anything that will dissolve and remove oil without injuring the skin:--

Hot water, as hot as you can stand it, is good; a little salt in it helps.

Hot soapy water is good.

Hot water with washing soda is good.

A wash of alcohol is good.

But best of all is a wash of strong alcohol in which is a little sugar of lead as an antiseptic.

of water might be sufficient, yet her length would be unmanageable
in the swift current and sharp turns.

The Planter must also be sent on a separate cruise, as her weak and disabled machinery made her useless
for my purpose.

Two hundred men were therefore transferred, as before, to the narrow hold of the John Adams,
in addition to the company permanently stationed on board to work
the guns.

       At seven o'clock on the evening of January 29th, beneath a lovely
moon, we steamed up the river.

  Partie plagiée: I know nothing in life more fascinating
than the nocturnal ascent of an unknown river, leading far into an enemy's country, where
one glides in the dim moonlight between dark hills and meadows, each turn of the channel making it seem
like an inland lake, and cutting you off as by a barrier from all
behind,--with no sign of human life, but an occasional picket-fire
left glimmering beneath the bank, or the yelp of a dog from some low-lying
plantation.

On such occasions every nerve is strained to its utmost tension; all dreams of romance appear
to promise immediate fulfilment; all lights on board the vessel are
obscured, loud voices are hushed; you fancy a thousand men on shore,
and yet see nothing; the lonely river, unaccustomed to furrowing keels,
lapses by the vessel with a treacherous sound; and all the senses
are merged in a sort of anxious trance.

Three tunes I have had in full perfection this fascinating experience;
but that night was the first, and its zest was the keenest.

It will come back to me in dreams, if I live a thousand years.

For one, I could never quite outgrow it, though restricted by duty from doing many foolish things
in consequence, and also restrained by reverence for certain confidential advisers whom I
had always at hand, and who considered it their mission to keep me
always on short rations of personal adventure.

Indeed, most of that sort of entertainment in the army devolves upon

All the excitements of war are quadrupled by darkness; and as I rode along our outer lines
at night, and watched the glimmering flames which at regular intervals starred the opposite river-shore,
the longing was irresistible to cross the barrier of dusk, and see
whether it were men or ghosts who hovered round those dying embers.

I had yielded to these impulses in boat-adventures by night,--for it was a part of my instructions
to obtain all possible information about the Rebel outposts,--and fascinating indeed it was to
glide along, noiselessly paddling, with a dusky guide, through the
endless intricacies of those Southern marshes, scaring the reed-birds,
which wailed and fled away into the darkness, and penetrating several
miles into the ulterior, between hostile fires, where discovery might
be death.

Yet there were drawbacks as to these enterprises, since it is not
easy for a boat to cross still water, even on the darkest night, without
being seen by watchful eyes; and, moreover, the extremes of high and
low tide transform so completely the whole condition of those rivers
that it needs very nice calculation to do one's work at precisely
the right tune.

The Sweetest Sad Song in the Woods

Once a great American poet was asked which he thought was the sweetest voice in the woods.
He said: "The sweetest sound in Nature is the calling of the Screech Owl."

Sometimes, though rarely, it does screech, but the sound it most often makes is the soft mournful
song that it sings in the woods at night, especially in the autumn nights.

It seems to be moaning a lament for the falling leaves, a sad good-bye to the dear dying summer.

Last autumn one sat above my head in the dark October woods, and put his little soul into a
song that seemed to be

        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        The leaves are falling:
        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        A sad voice calling;

The Sweetest Sad Song in the Woods

Once a great American poet was asked which he thought was the sweetest voice in the woods.
He said: "The sweetest sound in Nature is the calling of the Screech Owl."

Sometimes, though rarely, it does screech, but the sound it most often makes is the soft mournful
song that it sings in the woods at night, especially in the autumn nights.

It seems to be moaning a lament for the falling leaves, a sad good-bye to the dear dying summer.

Last autumn one sat above my head in the dark October woods, and put his little soul into a
song that seemed to be

        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        The leaves are falling:
        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        A sad voice calling;
        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        The Woodbirds flying;
        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        Sweet summer's dying,
        Dying, Dying.

A mist came into my eyes as I listened, and yet I thanked him
